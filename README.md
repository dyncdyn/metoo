Soma's Final Project -- #MeToo in China

- What is your project?

Our project is about #MeToo cases in China. The #MeToo movement in China cases took its peak in 2018 after nearly 60 rape/sexual assult cases reported in China. However, the movement has come to a cease for various reasons.
 
- Who are in the group?

Ming Li, Yinan and Arun
 
- Where is your data coming from?

Our dataset comes from a collection of thousands of social media accounts and news articles that are published before April 2019 about #MeToo cases in China. These articles are both in Chinese and English languages. The dataset will be created manually by a thorough reading of all the texts. Altogether about 60 individuals who have been charged of rape/sexual harassment. 
 
- Your current status in terms of data acquisition/analysis/visualization?

We are on the process of creating a dataset. The dataset will be analyzed on the basis of number of cases by year and month since 2018. We have roughly brainstormed four graphics for our project.
