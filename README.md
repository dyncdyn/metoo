### Soma's Final Project -- #MeToo in China


Our project is about #MeToo cases in China. The #MeToo movement in China cases took its peak in 2018 after nearly 60 rape/sexual assult cases reported in China. However, the movement has come to a cease for various reasons.
 
**Who are in the group?**

Ming Li, Yinan and Arun
 
**Where is your data coming from?**

Our dataset comes from a collection of thousands of social media accounts and news articles that are published before April 2019 about #MeToo cases in China. These articles are both in Chinese and English languages. The dataset has been created manually by a thorough reading of all the texts. Altogether 54 individuals who have been charged of rape/sexual harassment. 
 
**Your current status in terms of data acquisition/analysis/visualization?**

We have created a dataset for all reported cases. The dataset has been analyzed on the basis of number of cases by year and month since 2018. We have roughly brainstormed four graphics for our project.
